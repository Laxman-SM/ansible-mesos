Marathon Playbook for Ansible with HAProxy support.

This playbook will install Marathon and relies on the Mesos playbook. For HAProxy support HAProxy must be present before running Marathon.

## How to use this playbook?

Marathon is installed with HA mode activated [(see command line options)](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon#command-line-options). By default this playbook will look for hosts in the ```mesos_masters``` group to configure the required zookeeper support.

A cron job is configured to run the haproxy_dns_cfg script which will query the marathon api for applications and setup the appropriate frontend (listening on port 80) with backends for each application. HAProxy will look for a hostname prefixed with the application name and route to that backend. Using this technique you can wildcard a dns host to all your masters (say, *.example.com) and an application you launch (say, "myapp") will be available at myapp.example.com.

### Samples
This role is part of a mesos/marathon [sample playbook](https://github.com/mhamrah/ansible-mesos-playbook) which leverages this role to build a mesos cluster with separate master and slave nodes.
